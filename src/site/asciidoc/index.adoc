= Accurest Maven Plugin

Just to make long story short - Accurest is a tool that enables Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) development of JVM-based applications.

 * Stubs mappings to be used by WireMock when doing integration testing on the client code (client tests).

 * Acceptance tests used to verify if server-side implementation of the API is compliant with the contract (server tests).

Accurest moves TDD to the level of software architecture.
