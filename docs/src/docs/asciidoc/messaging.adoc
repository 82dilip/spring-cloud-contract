== Accurest Messaging

WARNING: Feature available since 1.0.7

Accurest allows you to verify your application that uses messaging as means of communication.
All of our integrations are working with Spring but you can also set one yourself.

=== Integrations

You can use one of the three integration configurations:

- Apache Camel
- Spring Integration
- Spring Cloud Stream

If you're using Spring Boot, the aforementioned test configurations will be appended automatically.

You have to provide as a dependency one of the Accurest Messaging modules. Example for Gradle:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
// for Apache Camel
testCompile "io.codearte.accurest:accurest-messaging-camel:${accurestVersion}"
// for Spring Integration
testCompile "io.codearte.accurest:accurest-messaging-integration:${accurestVersion}"
// for Spring Cloud Stream
testCompile "io.codearte.accurest:accurest-messaging-stream:${accurestVersion}"
----

=== Manual Integration

The `accurest-messaging-core` module contains 3 main interfaces:

- AccurestMessage - describes a message received / sent to a channel / queue / topic etc.
- AccurestMessageBuilder - describes how to build a message
- AccurestMessaging - class that allows you to build, send and receive messages

In the generated test the `AccurestMessaging` is injected via `@Inject` annotation thus you can use other injection
frameworks than Spring.

You have to provide as a dependency the `accurest-messaging-core` module. Example for Gradle:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
testCompile "io.codearte.accurest:accurest-messaging-core:${accurestVersion}"

=== Publisher side test generation

Having the `input` or `outputMessage` sections in your DSL will result in creation of tests on the publisher's side. By default
JUnit tests will be created, however there is also a possibility to create Spock tests.

=== Examples

There are 3 main scenarios that we should take into consideration:

- Scenario 1: there is no input message that produces an output one. The output message is triggered by a component
inside the application (e.g. scheduler)
- Scenario 2: the input message triggers an output message
- Scenarion 3: the input message is consumed and there is no output message

==== Scenario 1 (no input message)

For the given contract:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_dsl]
----

The following JUnit test will be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_junit_test]
----

And the following Spock test would be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_test]
----

==== Scenario 2 (output triggered by input)

For the given contract:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_message_dsl]
----

The following JUnit test will be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_message_junit]
----

And the following Spock test would be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_message_spock]
----

==== Scenario 3 (no output message)

For the given contract:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_no_output_dsl]
----

The following JUnit test will be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_no_output_junit]
----

And the following Spock test would be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../accurest-core/src/test/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_no_output_spock]
----

=== Consumer Stub Side generation

Unlike the HTTP part - in Messaging we need to publish the Groovy DSL inside the JAR with a stub. Then it's parsed on the consumer side
and proper stubbed routes are created.

For more infromation please consult the Stub Runner Messaging sections.

==== Gradle Setup

Example of Accurest Gradle setup:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../accurest-gradle-plugin/src/test/resources/functionalTest/scenarioProject/build.gradle[tags=jar_setup,indent=0]
----

==== Maven Setup

Example of Maven can be found in the [AccuREST Maven Plugin README](https://github.com/Codearte/accurest-maven-plugin/=publishing-wiremock-stubs-projectf-stubsjar)
