== Stub Runner for Messaging

WARNING: Feature available since {messaging_version}

Stub Runner has the functionality to run the published stubs in memory. It can integrate with the following frameworks out of the box

- Spring Integration
- Spring Cloud Stream
- Apache Camel

It also provides points of entry to integrate with any other solution on the market.

=== Stub triggering

To trigger a message it's enough to use the `StubTigger` interface:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../stub-runner/stub-runner/src/main/groovy/io/codearte/accurest/stubrunner/StubTrigger.groovy[]
----

For convenience the `StubFinder` interface extends `StubTrigger` so it's enough to use only one in your tests.

`StubTrigger` gives you the following options to trigger a message:

==== Trigger by label
