== Introduction

IMPORTANT: http://codearte.github.io/accurest[The documentation to the deprecated Accurest project in version 1.1.0 is available here.]

TIP: The Accurest project was initially started by Marcin Grzejszczak and Jakub Kubrynski (http://codearte.io[codearte.io])

Just to make long story short - Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a tool that enables Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) development of JVM-based applications. It is shipped
with __Contract Definition Language__ (DSL). Contract definitions are used to produce following resources:

* JSON stub definitions to be used by Wiremock when doing integration testing on the client code (__client tests__).
Test code must still be written by hand, test data is produced by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.
* Messaging routes if you're using one. We're integrating with Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream and Apache Camel. You can however set your own integrations if you want to
* Acceptance tests (in JUnit or Spock) used to verify if server-side implementation of the API is compliant with the contract (__server tests__).
Full test is generated by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier moves TDD to the level of software architecture.

=== Why?

Let us assume that we have a system comprising of multiple microservices:

==== Testing issues

If we wanted to test the application in top left corner if it can communicate with other services then we could do one of two things:

- deploy all microservices and perform end to end tests
- mock other microservices in unit / integration tests

Both have their advantages but also a lot of disadvantages. Let's focus on the latter.

*Deploy all microservices and perform end to end tests*

Advantages:

- simulates production
- tests real communication between services

Disadvantages:

- to test one microservice we would have to deploy 6 microservices, a couple of databases etc.
- the environment where the tests would be conducted would be locked for a single suite of tests (i.e. nobody else would be able to run the tests in the meantime).
- long to run
- very late feedback
- extremely hard to debug

*Mock other microservices in unit / integration tests*

Advantages:

- very fast feedback
- no infrastructure requirements

Disadvantages:

- the implementor of the service creates stubs thus they might have nothing to do with the reality
- you can go to production with passing tests and failing production

To solve the aforementioned issues Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner were created. Their main idea is to give you very fast feedback, without the need
to set up the whole world of microservices.

If you work on stubs then the only applications you need are those that your application is using directly.

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier gives you the certainty that the stubs that you're using were created by the service that you're calling. Also if you can use them it means that they were
tested against the producer's side. In other words - you can trust those stubs.


=== Purposes

The main purposes of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner are:

  - to ensure that WireMock / Messaging stubs (used when developing the client) are doing exactly what actual server-side implementation will do,
  - to promote ATDD method and Microservices architectural style,
  - to provide a way to publish changes in contracts that are immediately visible on both sides,
  - to generate boilerplate test code used on the server side.

=== Client Side

During the tests you want to have a Wiremock instance / Messaging route up and running that simulates the service Y.
You would like to feed that instance with a proper stub definition. That stub definition would need
to be valid and should also be reusable on the server side.

__Summing it up:__ On this side, in the stub definition, you can use patterns for request stubbing and you need exact
values for responses.

=== Server Side

Being a service Y since you are developing your stub, you need to be sure that it's actually resembling your
concrete implementation. You can't have a situation where your stub acts in one way and your application on
production behaves in a different way.

That's why from the provided stub acceptance tests will be generated that will ensure
that your application behaves in the same way as you define in your stub.

__Summing it up:__ On this side, in the stub definition, you need exact values as request and can use patterns/methods
for response verification.

== Step by step guide to CDC

Let's take an example of Fraud Detection and Loan Issuance process. Let's assume that the Loan Issuance is a client to the
Fraud Detection server. Let's assume that we have to write a new feature (if a client wants too borrow too much money then
we mark him as fraud). The current implementation grants loan to everybody.

Of course both client and server development teams need to communicate directly and discuss changes while
going through the process. CDC is all about communication.

The code is available under the `samples/samples-standalone/http-server` and `samples/samples-standalone/http-client` folders.

As a developer of the Loan Issuance service (a consumer to the Fraud Detection server):

- start doing TDD by writing a test to your feature
- at some point in time you need to send a request to the Fraud Detection service
- you clone the Fraud Detection service repository locally
- you define the contract locally in the repo of Fraud Detection service
- provide the group id and artifact id for the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner to download stubs of your collaborators
- also provide the offline work switch since you don't want to work offline
- when you need to install the stubs of the server side you execute e.g. `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests` in their repo
- when you're happy with the contract and your test passes publish a PR to the server side

As a developer of the Fraud Detection server (a server to the Loan Issuance service):

- take over the PR (if you try to build it your app will break cause you have a missing implementation)
- write the missing implementation
- deploy your app with the stubs e.g. `./mvnw clean deploy` you'll publish both the application fat jar and the stub jar

As a developer of the Loan Issuance service (a consumer to the Fraud Detection server):

- since the server side work was done you can merge the branch to master
- disable the offline work for Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner
- at this moment the stubs of the server side will be automatically downloaded from Nexus / Artifactory

=== Why use Spring Cloud Contract Verifier and not X ?

For the time being Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a JVM based tool. So it could be your first pick when you're already creating
software for the JVM. This project has a lot of really interesting features but especially quite a few of them definitely make
Spring Cloud Contract Verifier stand out on the "market" of Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) tooling. Out of many the most interesting are:

- Possibility to do CDC with messaging
- Clear and easy to use, statically typed DSL
- Possibility to copy paste your current JSON file to the contract and only edit its elements
- Automatic generation of tests from the defined Contract
- Stub Runner functionality - the stubs are automatically downloaded at runtime from Nexus / Artifactory
- Spring Cloud integration - no discovery service is needed for integration tests
